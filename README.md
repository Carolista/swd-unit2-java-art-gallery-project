# swd-unit2-java-art-gallery-project
A multi-part project to teach LaunchCode students to build a Java web application with Spring Boot in conjunction with an SQL database.

### HOW TO USE THIS REPO
Unlike some of my other repos, the entire finished project is in the `main` branch.

If you wish to code the project from the beginning or from any point along the way, choose from several branches for the starter code. The starter code for most branches is essentially the solution to the previous branch, and `main` is the final solution.
